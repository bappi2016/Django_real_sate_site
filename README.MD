## Setup In Local Machine

First step- Create a directory or folder for the project where you want to copy this in your local machine.
You can use any existing folder or directory if you want.


Open the directory or the project folder in an editor and then open the CLI of the editor .
In the CLI make sure you are in your exact path of the folder or directory 
Clone this project or fork and clone your fork url and paste it in the CLI and hit enter

```
git clone https://github.com/bappi2016/Django_real_state.git

```
Then go to the project root directory, here the name is django_startup

```
cd django_startup 
```
Here the django_startup is our project root directory 

Second Step- Create a virtual environment in your current directory for this project and activate it
Make sure you are in the project root directory that is django_startup

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
sudo pip3 install virtualenv 
python3 -m venv ./venv
``` 
. is used for referring the current directory.
Here ./venv will create a virtual environment is this current project directory what exactly we want
Check there is a folder or directory created inside the django_startup project directory
Now activate the virtual environment.

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
If virtual environment successfully activated it will show something like the following line in you CLI
(venv) bappi@bappi-pc:~/DJANGO_FOLDER/django_startup$ 


Now run and install django 

```
pip install django 
``` 
Check the version of django 

```
python -m django â€“version
```


### Setup PostgreSQL in local machine

1. Downlaod and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 
2. Run the PostgreSQL in your machine
3. Download [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org) if you prefer managing PostgreSQL visually
4. Run pgAdmin to create database visually
5. Or Create a database in PostgreSQL in terminal
6. Update django frameworks's project settings django_startup/djangostartup/settings.py

```Python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
    
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": "YOUR_LOCAL_DB_NAME",
        "USER": "YOUR_POSTGRESQL_USER_NAME",
        "PASSWORD": "YOUR_POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD",
        "HOST": "localhost",
}  }

``` 

7. Apply database migration from django to postgresql
This will convert all the models to SQL tables in postgresql

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

8. Start django server locally
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

9. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in a web browser to see the following webpage.

## How to use admin panel to manage contents

1. First create a superuser
```shell
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
2. Now run the server again
```shell
python3 manage.py runserver
```
